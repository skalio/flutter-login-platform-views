Flutter Web Login Autofill Example

This project demonstrates how to create custom HTML input elements with proper autocomplete attributes and embed them into a Flutter web app using HtmlElementView. This approach enables password managers to recognize and autofill login fields seamlessly.

The code registers platform views that wrap native HTML input elements with autocomplete attributes, and embeds them into the Flutter widget tree, allowing password managers to interact with them naturally.
